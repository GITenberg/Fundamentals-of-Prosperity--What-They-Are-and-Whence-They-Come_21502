description: '"People have forgotten the gospel of service. The producing power per
  man has fallen off from fifteen to twenty percent. We have all been keen on developing
  consumption. We have devoted nine-tenths of our thought, energy and effort to developing
  consumption. This message is to beg of every reader to give more thought to developing
  production, to the reviving of a desire to produce and the realization of joy in
  production."--Foreword.'
